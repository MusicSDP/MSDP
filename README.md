Section 1: Follow these Instructions before running Music_SDP’s source code.

In order to run Music_SDP you must first take care of three things:

1. Make sure that Max 7.1 or later is installed. (MSDP has some issues in 7.0)
2. Make sure that you have installed the appropriate version of Java and JVM. (Max will provide a link upon launching Music_SDP if you don’t have the appropriate files installed.)
3. Install all of the fonts included in the “fonts” folder.

These steps should only be necessary once. After this is complete, Music_SDP should be opened from the “_Music_SDP.maxpat” file, located in the root folder. Opening this file loads all of the appropriate folders into the search path.

Section 2: Instructions for using and editing Music_SDP’s source code

The “_Music_SDP.maxpat” file should be opened first, regardless of what other patches you want to explore in the system. Forgetting to do this can cause any number of errors, as necessary sub-patches will fail to load.

Note about editing Music_SDP:
In order to unlock and edit patches, you must first go to the Menu Bar and select “Max Menus” from the file menu. This will return the original set of menus and will allow the user to use all of the default shortcuts.

Note about “unsticking” patches:
Certain patches, like the System Board, the Pedal Board, and the Project Loader are locked down so that they can not be resized, closed, or minimized by the user. Unlocking the patch will reveal a secondary button that allows the user to “unstick” the sizing of the patch. Clicking this button will return the use of zoom, resize, close and minimize.

Note about making changes to the Pedal Board:
The Pedal Board automatically generates sub-patches for the first module. These must all be deleted before saving the Pedal Board, or the board will be broken when re-opened. If you find that the Pedal Boards aren’t working properly, check the code to see if you have duplicate module windows. If so, delete all matrices and module windows, save, and re-open the Pedal Board.
