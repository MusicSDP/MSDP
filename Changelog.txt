Music_SDP changelog:
[Beta 1.0.3.14] 2016-03-16
Changed:
	•	Huge revision to preset system. Presets now get copied over into new projects so that defaults can be saved over by the user. Also presets are saved automatically and are unique to each project.
	•	Cleaning up System Board and Full Views. Uniformly darker now, with updates to image files and new “Save Settings” image for the System Settings View.

[Beta 1.0.3.7] 2016-03-14
Changed:
	•	Continuing to clean up the System Board to make is identical across platforms.
	•	Fixed a new bug with 7.2.1 that caused the standalone to launch with the max console open!

[Beta 1.0.3.5] 2016-03-10
Changed:
	•	Many sends have been renamed with ‘MSDP_’ prepended to them. This is to keep in-line with other system sends.
	•	The ‘Important Files’ folder no longer exists. All of the folders that were in here now exist in the main ’System Files’ folder. This makes more sense, since all System Files are important files.
	• The Launcher and the 'Choose1' patch have been updated to recognize the new system structure.

[Beta 1.0.3.2] 2016-03-08
Changed
	•	Continuing to tweak the System Board. A New “New Board” button and record button accompany a larger redo of the System Board.

[Beta 1.0.3] 2016-03-05
Changed:
	•	Multiple tweaks to the System Board, Master Mixer, and Performer View to unify the look across OS X and Windows

Added:
	•	Michael Mann’s implementation of the Moog Ladder Filter has been added to the filter list.

[Beta 1.0.2.2] 2016-03-03
Changed:
	•	Changes have been made to the Full View toggle and the Add New Button on the System Board to allow for more uniformity between the OSX and Windows versions.
	•	The Full View Tabs have been tweaked slightly
	•	The About screen is now a separate patcher, to make it easier to modify without having to re-build the system board

Added:
	•	The Metronome now displays the current beat in the top row of controls.

[Beta 1.0.2.1] 2016-02-29
Added:
	•	The Saved and Loaded Boards now have the ability to Save and Save As
Changed:
	•	The Blank Template now uses autopattr to determine which ui elements can be stored, instead of having to write out separate pattr objects

[Beta 1.0.2] 2016-02-26
Changed:
	•	The Drum Machine has been optimized quite a bit and is significantly more CPU efficient.

Added:

[Beta 1.0.1.5] 2016-02-25
Fixed:
	•	The Additive Synthesizer no longer plays stuck notes upon reloading with the arpeggiator turned on. 
Changed:
	•	The MSDP_Dial now displays the number you enter as you manually type it. Numbers that are too long get truncated, instead of pouring over onto the next screen.
	•	The MSDP_Dial can now have either float or int selected as the fourth argument in the bpatcher.
	•	The Blank Module has been updated with more info on the MSDP_Dial.
 
[Beta 1.0.1.4] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Saved and Loaded Boards now wait until all of the modules have been loaded before setting the routing name to the modules, ensuring that ALL parameters get sent out properly.

[Beta 1.0.1.3] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Pedal Board and Saved Board now deletes any bpatchers that have been accidentally saved last time the board was edited. This makes it harder to “break” the boards by mistake.


[Beta 1.0.1.1] 2016-02-22
Changed: 
	•	jit.matrix in the Pedal Board is no longer created every time a new board is loaded. It’s now constant, and is renamed on each new open.
	•	This change has been made to the Saved Board and Loaded Board as well.
 
Fixed:
	•	Saved Board and Loaded Board will successfully save changes made now across all modules, the first time.
