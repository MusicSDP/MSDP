Music_SDP changelog:

[Beta 1.1.5] 2017-05-26

Major Project Updates:

Sierra support has been implemented - An overhaul to processes behind how we build Music_SDP means that Sierra’s new security measures no longer break the functionality of our program. 

Mac installer is now simpler - No more folder structure, no more extra installs. Just open the installer and follow the one simple step to get everything you need up and running.

Java has been removed - Thanks to a new external, Music_SDP no longer relies on Java to control project file management. Because of this, no user needs to install or maintain any version of Java in order to run Music_SDP on either Windows or MacOS. This also frees up system resources, meaning you should be able to do more in Music_SDP before running out of CPU overhead.

Source-Code includes new launch options - For Max users who want to look at the source code, new launch options have been added, making it easier to test code and to explore patches.

GitHub has relaunched for access to experimental releases - Source-code users may now look to our GitHub repository to find our most recent experimental releases. Keep up-to-date with all of our work as we make headway towards the next stable release, and try out new features along with us.

New Module:

Chopper 2 - New live audio chopper with a multitude of options that allow for unexpected glitchy results. Includes Basic mode, Grid mode, and Keyboard mode.

System Updates:

Music_SDP folder now added to Documents tree - When launching Music_SDP for the first time, either as an application or as source code, a new set of folders will be added to your Documents path. These folders allow Music_SDP to keep track of projects from a central location, and make it easy to add third party modules without having to re-install them when new releases to the application come out.

Cleaner, rewritten project loader - The project loader now closes entirely once a project is selected, freeing up system resources. Behind the scenes, the code has been cleaned up, making it easier for explorers to navigate the inner-workings of the patch.

Fixes:

EZ File Player no longer outputs to a mystery source - The mystery output source has been tracked down and eliminated.

Gater no longer sends out bangs to console when activated

Fixes applied to System Board - Several small fixes and improvements have been made across the system board code.

“Unidentified Developer” issue resolved - We are finally Apple Certified developers, and it is reflected in the installation process on MacOS. Users should no longer encounter “App is Broken” message, or the message stating the Music_SDP is from an “unidentified developer”. You’ll still be asked to confirm that you want to open an application that’s been downloaded from the internet.
