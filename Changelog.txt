Music_SDP changelog:

[Beta 1.0.1.4] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Saved and Loaded Boards now wait until all of the modules have been loaded before setting the routing name to the modules, ensuring that ALL parameters get sent out properly.

[Beta 1.0.1.3] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Pedal Board and Saved Board now deletes any bpatchers that have been accidentally saved last time the board was edited. This makes it harder to “break” the boards by mistake.


[Beta 1.0.1.1] 2016-02-22
Changed: 
	•	jit.matrix in the Pedal Board is no longer created every time a new board is loaded. It’s now constant, and is renamed on each new open.
	•	This change has been made to the Saved Board and Loaded Board as well.
 
Fixed:
	•	Saved Board and Loaded Board will successfully save changes made now across all modules, the first time.

Added:
	•	New Contribution/Atribution screen accessible from the About Music_SDP window.

	•	new readme.rtf file added to source code.
Changed:
	•	Live.Dials have been replaced with MSDP_Dials in all applicable modules.
Fixed:
	•	Retuner works again.
	•	Panner works on app and exe now (found missing subpatch).
	•	Master Volume Slider on the Performer View is working again.
	•	Audio glitch fixed where clicks could be heard when changing volume via dials. New patch created called “MSDP_vol_fix”, used to scale signal heading out of modules.
