Music_SDP changelog:

[Beta 1.0.2.1] 2016-02-29
Added:
	•	The Saved and Loaded Boards now have the ability to Save and Save As
Changed:
	•	The Blank Template now uses autopattr to determine which ui elements can be stored, instead of having to write out separate pattr objects
	•	The About Page now says 1.0.3, in advance of the next update.

[Beta 1.0.2] 2016-02-26
Changed:
	•	The Drum Machine has been optimized quite a bit and is significantly more CPU efficient.

[Beta 1.0.1.6] 2016-02-26
Added:
	•	The Virtual Pads have been built and have been added to the Controller Setup and the Menu Bar.
[Beta 1.0.1.5] 2016-02-25
Fixed:
	•	The Additive Synthesizer no longer plays stuck notes upon reloading with the arpeggiator turned on. 
Changed:
	•	The MSDP_Dial now displays the number you enter as you manually type it. Numbers that are too long get truncated, instead of pouring over onto the next screen.
	•	The MSDP_Dial can now have either float or int selected as the fourth argument in the bpatcher.
	•	The Blank Module has been updated with more info on the MSDP_Dial.
 
[Beta 1.0.1.4] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Saved and Loaded Boards now wait until all of the modules have been loaded before setting the routing name to the modules, ensuring that ALL parameters get sent out properly.

[Beta 1.0.1.3] 2016-02-24
Fixed:
	•	Pedal Board and Saved Board now deletes any bpatchers that have been accidentally saved last time the board was edited. This makes it harder to “break” the boards by mistake.


[Beta 1.0.1.1] 2016-02-22
Changed: 
	•	jit.matrix in the Pedal Board is no longer created every time a new board is loaded. It’s now constant, and is renamed on each new open.
	•	This change has been made to the Saved Board and Loaded Board as well.
 
Fixed:
	•	Saved Board and Loaded Board will successfully save changes made now across all modules, the first time.

Added:
	•	New Contribution/Atribution screen accessible from the About Music_SDP window.
	•	New custom dials, MSDP_Dial_1, 2, 3 and MSDP_Dial_S1,2,3
	•	new readme.rtf file added to source code.
Changed:
	•	Live.Dials have been replaced with MSDP_Dials in all applicable modules.
Fixed:
	•	Retuner works again.
	•	Panner works on app and exe now (found missing subpatch).
	•	Master Volume Slider on the Performer View is working again.
	•	Audio glitch fixed where clicks could be heard when changing volume via dials. New patch created called “MSDP_vol_fix”, used to scale signal heading out of modules.
