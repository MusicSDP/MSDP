## For the new user…
Do you want to create live visuals but don’t know where to start? You just opened MaxMSP for the first time and you want to have some fun? With VIZZIE, you just grab a few simple modules, connect them together and almost instantly have a VJ rig or interactive video work, complete with real-time effects.

## For the experienced user…
Imagine this scenario: It’s 8:50 p.m. and the band is getting ready to play. Someone found a projector in the closet, and they are looking at you. You’ve got ten minutes to come up with something to project. Impossible? Maybe not…

The VIZZIE modules let you drop in video players, effects boxes, automation generators and MIDI connections in minutes. Since it’s all Jitter under the hood, it works seamlessly with all of the Jitter programming you already know. Even if you are a Jitter master, VIZZIE will help you get it done before the show begins.
